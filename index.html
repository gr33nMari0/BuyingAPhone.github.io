				<h2 class="assess1">Assess your Situation</h2>
				<p class="situation1">Mobile phones are complicated devices to buy and prices can range from under <strong>$50</strong> to thousands of dollars. There are many different brands with different phone models - including cellphones or smartphones. Cell phones are simple and are generally much cheaper - these are generally simple, have big buttons and a simple interface - great for young children or for the elderly. They have simple functions such as calls and texting but lack social media and internet access.</p><br>
				<p class="situation2"> Smartphones, on the other hand, involve online capabilities, including apps, video, music as well as calls and text. These devices are bigger, with large touch screens, and are generally between <strong>$500</strong> to <strong>$800</strong>. This means they have more features but they are more expensive.</p><br>
				<p class="situation3">Before buying, you need to decide what you need in a phone - Internet, social media, big buttons, touch screens etc. You also need to decide how much money you need to spend on the device itself.</p>

				<h2 class="assess1">You need to ask yourself these questions:</h2>
				<ol id="questions">
					<li>What is your budget?</li><br>
					<li>Do you have an existing phone or phone plan?</li><br>
					<li>Do you need to use a different mobile carrier?</li><br>
					<li>Do you need internet access?</li><br>
					<li>How much data would you use?</li><br>
					<li>Do you need a certain amount of calls and texts per month or unlimited?</li><br>
					<li>Are you OK with being locked into a mobile contract?</li><br>
					<li>Do you need a smartphone or a cellphone?</li><br>
					<li>Would you prefer to buy a phone outright or get one with a phone plan?</li><br>

			<h1>Phone or bundled contract</h1>
			<p>When you are ready to buy a phone, and you have a good idea of the features you need, you can look at buying a phone. You have 2 choices here - buy the phone outright, (meaning buying it without a phone plan) or to buy it with a contract, in a <a href="Sites/Buying a Phone plan/index.html">phone plan</a>. This video from the Checkout might give you a help deciding on buying your new phone.</p>

			<p>Phones can easily be purchased with cash/card in a store or online. Many shops to buy a phone are available, but if you want to buy an expensive phone that brand's store may be a long way away.</p>

			<p>Remember important things such as your <a href="Sites/Rights/index.html">Personal Rights</a>, and also remember that is is easy to have an upgrade to your plan, or get a better phone model etc - but it is much harder to downgrade, even if you want to. Ask the sales assistants if there are any specific deals available - some companies will offer devices cheaper in bundles with a phone plan or internet plan, or deals if you want a refurbished phone for example.</p>

				<p class="situation1">Mobile phones are complicated devices to buy and prices can range from under <strong>$50</strong> to thousands of dollars. There are many different brands with different phone models - including cellphones or smartphones. Cell phones are simple and are generally much cheaper - these are generally simple, have big buttons and a simple interface - great for young children or for the elderly. They have simple functions such as calls and texting but lack social media and internet access.</p><br>
				<p class="situation2"> Smartphones, on the other hand, involve online capabilities, including apps, video, music as well as calls and text. These devices are bigger, with large touch screens, and are generally between <strong>$500</strong> to <strong>$800</strong>. This means they have more features but they are more expensive.</p><br>
				<p class="situation3">Before buying, you need to decide what your need in a phone - Internet, social media, big buttons, touch screens etc. You also need to decide how much money you need to spend on the device itself.</p>

			<h1>Tricky Telcos</h1>
			<p>Although telcos might make you seem like you have no power over a contract, or over a locked phone etc, you still have full Australian rights such as repair, replace refund or the ability to leave a mobile contract mid-period.</p><br><br>
			<h2>Repair, Replace, Refund</h2>
			<p>In accordance with the Australian laws you are entitled to have your phone repaired, replaced or refunded at the discretion of the seller - but only if it has a major or a minor fault.</p>
			<p><span class="italic">From the ACCC website: </span>You can ask a business for your preference of a free repair, replacement or refund, but you are not always entitled to one. For example, the consumer guarantees do not apply if you got what you asked for but simply changed your mind, found it cheaper somewhere else, decided you did not like the purchase or had no use for it.</p>
			<p>If you have a <span class="bold">minor problem</span> with a product or service, the business can choose to give you a free repair instead of a replacement or refund. When you have a <span class="bold">major problem</span> with a product, you have the right to ask for your choice of a replacement or refund. For a major problem with a <span class="bold">service</span>, you can choose to receive compensation for the drop in value below the price paid, or a refund.</p>
			<p>This is helpful as now you know that if a telco or a phone seller sends you a phone and it is for example broken, you can get a replacement or a refund no matter what they say, even if they have signs saying "NO REFUNDS". In fact, it is illegal for them to have such signs and they can be given fines until they take them down.</p><br><br><br>
			<h2>Phone contract rights</h2>
			<p>As part of the consumer law, you have these 6 main rights:<br><br>
				<ol>
					<li>Cancel your contract if the telco or salesperson has made false or misleading claims, or if the product or service doesn't do what it is supposed to.</li>
					<li>Compare phone plans in a way that's easy to understand, with access to critical information summaries outlining a unit price and key information before signing on to a contract.</li>
					<li>Be protected from bill shock with data usage notifications and global roaming cost notifications.</li>
					<li>Have your phone last the length of the contract on which you've bought it.</li>
					<li>Have your disputes resolved in an efficient and satisfactory manner, and at no cost.</li>
					<li>Pay your bill in a flexible manner if you're experiencing payment difficulties.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>This helps you realise you can get the telcos to work for you, as they will risk losing a customer (their worst nightmare) if they don't. If you wanted to switch plans halfway through for example, you could easily contact your provider and request to have your contract terminated. If you bought a phone in the plan, they would get you to pay the remaining fees for the phone. Also, they legally have to unlock the phone to other providers if you ask them to.</p><br><br><br>

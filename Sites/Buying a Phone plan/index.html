				<h1>Buying a phone plan</h1>
				<p>A phone plan is a contract/agreement between a user and a telecommunications company allowing the user access to that companies' network. Different companies offer different plans, and every company has different network coverage. There are many types of plans including SIM only, PAYG, pay all in one go, internet plans, or bundles with phones and phone plans.
				Phones calls and texts used to be important - you had to pay for each call or text by the minute. Nowadays, telco's offer unlimited talk and text on most of their plans. This means now you have to worry about data (internet access on your phone) because telco's will suck your money for this.</p>
				<h2>Choosing a provider</h2>
				<p>There are many different companies who provide network coverage around the world. Some of the biggest in Australia include Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone - other popular networks like Alidmobile or Boost simply use the same network as either Telstra or Optus.</p>

				<h1>Contracts</h1>
				<p>When buying a phone plan, you need to realise that the contract is legally binding. A contract can be either not locked or a locked contract - locked contracts can be anywhere from a couple of months to 24 months. This is especially bad if you buy a phone in a plan, as not only will the company give you a lock-in contract until you pay for your phone completely, but in future that phone will be locked in to that companies network. And, it used to be illegal to manually unlock a phone from its network even after the contract ended but now the device can be unlocked <strong style="font-size:105%;">only when the contract is finished.</strong></p>
				<h2>Beware</h2>
				<p>Telco's offer various plans, but if you want to buy a phone with a phone plan you need to remember that they will keep you locked in until the plan is over - and if you want to quit before then not only will you have to pay for the phone outright you will also have to pay an exit fee, and this can be a lot of money.</p>
